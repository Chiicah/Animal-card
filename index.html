            Ruby is our little sweetheart of just 5 years old. She spent the
            early years of her life as a victim of the dog meat trade. We found
            her in a cage filled with other dogs in unimaginable conditions and
            thought her dead. We had the means only to adopt one dog and Ruby
            already spoke to our hearts. There was no way we could leave her
            there to continue in such inhumane and unimaginable life. We adopted
            her and she's been part of our family since then.
            <br />
            They're however lots of other dogs that could be saved today with
            your help. Adopt one dog and save a life!
